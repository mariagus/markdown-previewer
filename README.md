## Markdown

My second React project, which I built as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) front-end library certification.

In order to build this app, I had to use a library (React-Markdown) for handling the Markdown parsing. This taught me how to make use of npm libraries in React applications and how to decipher library documentation.

## Tech stack

- React

## How to run the app
